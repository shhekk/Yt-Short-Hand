yt-short-hand is a yoututbe extention which maps 's' and 'd' with left skip and right skip respectively.
it is under development with more upcoming features
the goal is to do most of the activity with right hand on keyboard.
i made this extension for my own ease
if you have any idea related to key bindings do lmk
